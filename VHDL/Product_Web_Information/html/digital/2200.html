		<h3>VeriBest aggressively supports your critical need to leverage ASIC, FPGA,
		CPLD &amp; PLD technology in today’s high pressure design arena. VeriBest
		delivers powerful, language-based, VHDL and Verilog environments.</h3>
		<h3>VeriBest meets the challenge of increasing device complexity by providing
		team-based design
		and shorter design cycles. This is achieved through built-in support for design-reuse
		(IP) and fundamental productivity enhancements that HDL design methodologies deliver.</h3>

<table><tr valign="top"><td><h3>VeriBest is committed to helping you make the move to HDL in a productive and
	comfortable manner. </h3>
<p>With the announcement of 1 Million gate FPGA devices and as the average FPGA/CPLD
design exceeds 20,000 gates, traditional schematic-only design definition techniques
are no longer appropriate. As a result, VeriBest is aggressively introducing
schematic-based designers to well managed, team-wide HDL-based design, while being
sensitive to the retooling effort required to utilize HDL-based methodologies.

<h4>DESIGN DEFINITION</h4>
<P>VeriBest is the easy way to get the design definition capabilities and versatility
you need to realize maximum design functionality.
<P>If you are a system-level or system on FPGA designer, it’s obvious that the pressure
	to get to market faster without compromising product cost-effectiveness and
	reliability is enormous. Today, the best way to get the job done is to leverage
	and utilize faster and more flexible Design Management and Definition techniques
	in your programmable logic and ASIC environments. VeriBest supports the critical
	and proven disciplines needed for productivity improvement - design configuration
	management, version control, the integration of both graphical design entry
	(state machines, flow charts and state/truth tables) and HDL capabilities with the
	traditional schematic capture tool. VeriBest provides graphical, high-level design
	capabilities with VeriBest Graphical High Level Design (VBGHLD) that allows you to
	define the workings of a state machine in an easy, graphical manner. Once defined,
	this graphical component is easily inserted into your schematic design. There is
	also VeriBest HDL Writer, a powerful, language-sensitive text editor for both VHDL
	and Verilog, for use when a particular function is best defined in a text format.

<h4>
SYNTHESIS</h4>
<P>Industry leading synthesis performance for the FPGA, CPLD &amp; PLD designer. 
<P>SYNTHESIS is no longer exclusive to the ASIC designer. Now, all digital designers
can take advantage of language-based design, making it an important and valuable
component in the toolbox. The differences between ASIC, FPGA, CPLD and PLD device
architectures demand different synthesis strategies. VERIBEST PLD delivers
premium-quality device support and selection for the vast number of PLD/CPLD
technologies now available. VeriBest’S DESKTOP TEAM and DESKTOP INDIVIDUAL meets
the needs of the team based or individual FPGA/CPLD designer, with a choice of
Synopsys FPGA Express&#153; or Synplicity Synplify&#153; synthesis technologies as their
engines. For the ASIC designer, VERIBEST ORIGIN provides open access to Synopsys
Design Compiler, Ambit’s Build Gates or any other ASIC or FPGA tool of choice.
The VeriBest SYNTHESIS solution enables you to leverage HDL’s with device-specificity
to get the most out of the ASIC, FPGA, CPLD and PLD technologies available today.

<h4>VENDOR PARTNERSHIPS</h4>
<P>VeriBest has invested in partnerships with the key industry leaders to ensure
high quality tool integration. 
<P>VeriBest provides you with a simple and efficient implementation flow,
incorporating the selected silicon vendor’s tool set. VeriBest’s iNTerop Partnership
Program provides the basis for ongoing and supportive communications with such
industry leaders as Synopsys, Ambit, Synplicity, Xilinx, Altera, Actel, Lucent,
Motorola, Lattice, AMI, and Atmel. These strong partnerships allow VeriBest to
continue providing you with functional access to the latest ASIC, FPGA, CPLD and
PLD technology on the market today.

<h4>SIMULATION</h4>
<P>VeriBest delivers simulation technology that is second to none.
<P>VeriBest offers two powerful simulation products - VERIBEST VHDL SIMULATOR and
VERIBEST VERILOG SIMULATOR. VERIBEST VHDL SIMULATOR is VeriBest’s flagship simulator
featuring full VHDL-93 compliance and VHDL-87 support. The power of the VERIBEST VHDL
SIMULATOR simulation engine is further enhanced with an easy and intuitive user
interface. VERIBEST VHDL SIMULATOR is designed with both the chip and board designer
in mind, supporting system modeling libraries, such as Synopsys SmartModels® and
hardware modelers. Included with VERIBEST VHDL SIMULATOR is VERIBEST WAVEBENCH -
featuring a full graphical waveform entry capability that minimizes the time-consuming
task of stimulus generation. VERIBEST VHDL SIMULATOR also makes design debugging faster
and more efficient with features like the Network Traverser - tracing the driver
network of a particular signal so you can vector in quickly and effectively. 
<P>VERIBEST VERILOG SIMULATOR is a Verilog-XL clone that provides you with a powerful
and integrated simulation environment. VERIBEST VERILOG SIMULATOR was named overall
winner of the  DA Solutions HDL simulation benchmark. VERIBEST VERILOG SIMULATOR is
also system simulation capable, supporting the Synopsys SmartModels® and hardware
modelers, and is also bundled with VERIBEST WAVEBENCH.

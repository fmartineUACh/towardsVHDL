!
!	Configuration file for PCB data. This file holds the following data :
!
!		a) the invented circuit reference prefix. When we package
!		   logical parts into physical parts, we have to invent some
!		   new physical parts. The circuit reference that we assign to
!		   this physical part is user definable. For instance maybe
!		   you want them to be called IC... something then enter 'IC',
!		   or U... then enter 'U'.
!		   This reference is also used to define the circuit reference
!		   for all IC's. Specified in the '*INVENTED_CCT_REFS' section.
!
!		b) circuit references for packagable devices appear in the
!		   '*PACKAGABLE_CCT_REF' section with one entry per line. For
!		   instance if gates of an IC are labelled 'G...' ( eg G1 ) then
!		   enter 'G' on a line. A maximum of sixteen entries may be
!		   specified.
!
!		c) circuit references for plugs. This is the leading part
!		   of the circuit reference, so if we enter PL, then any cct-ref
!		   that matches PL* will be teated as a plug. This allows a
!		   program to recognise plugs and to treat them differently when
!		   necessary. There may be several entries for plugs, upto a
!		   maximum of eight.
!
!		d) the net names for the power nets are specified in the
!		   '*POWER_NETS' section, one entry per line. You can include
!		   the names of any net that is used for power, irrespective of
!		   whether or not it appears on the current design. For instance
!		   you might use the net names of 'VCC' and 'GND' as power nets
!		   or '+5V', '0V'... etc. After the netname is a character which
!		   specifies the signal level of the power net. The allowed
!		   characters are '+', '0' or '-' for positive, zero and
!		   negative voltages respectivly. A maximum of sixteen power
!		   nets may be specified.
!
!		e) the extension format that the user has used for IC's ( and
!		   will be used for back-annotation of gates ) are specified
!		   in the '*PRE-PACKAGED_IC_FORMAT' section. The allowed
!		   entries are a set of strings ( enclosed in quotes ) the word
!		   LOWERCASE_ALPHA, the word UPPERCASE_ALPHA, the word
!		   NUM_PARTS. For example
!		   If user specifies			   Example
!			UPPERCASE_ALPHA 		    IC12A
!			LOWERCASE_ALPHA 		    IC12a
!			'-' UPPERCASE_ALPHA                 IC12-A
!			'-' LOWERCASE_ALPHA                 IC12-a
!			.etc
!		   The entries on this line are seperated by spaces.
!
!	Notes:
!		Exclamation marks are treated as comments.
!		Any empty line is ignored.
!		Any data on a line must start in column one of the line.
!		Don't use wild cards - they are not expanded.

<H2>VeriBest's Analog Simulation Environment Provides a Complete Modeling
Solution Allowing Engineers to Leverage All Possibilities.</H2>

<H3>VeriBest recognizes that even though we provide you with a state-of-the-art
analog simulation engine, VBASE, you cannot realize &quot;true&quot; productivity
without a wide variety of model options. Thus, VeriBest Analog has been
designed to accept models from a number of different sources giving you
access to over 30,000 devices that are ready-to-use.</H3>

<H4>6100+ VeriBest Developed and Delivered Models</H4>

<P>VeriBest has engineered and verified the 6100+ models available in our
currently delivered library.&nbsp;These models run the gamut from discrete
devices (diodes and transistors) to complicated analog ICs (op-amps, comparators,
regulators, etc.) and from native-digital parts (gates, flip-flops, buffers,
etc.) to behavioral functional blocks (adders, integrators, ADC/DACs, pole-zero
blocks, etc.).</P>

<H4>Model Templates</H4>

<P>VeriBest provides you with generic model templates for creating your
own models from device datasheets. Models for component parts such as transistors,
diodes, op-amps, references, regulators, and comparators can easily be created
by editing the model template and saving it to a new name.</P>

<H4>AHDL Modeling</H4>

<P>If a higher level of abstraction is required, VeriBest Analog provides
a very robust analog HDL called DIABLO. Using C-like syntax, built-in math
functions, and direct calls to the simulator, a designer can quickly create
a model for any &quot;black box&quot; behavior that can be expressed mathematically.
If you have an equation for it, you can model it with DIABLO. Not just electrical
behavior - mechanical, optical, thermal or physical devices can all be modeled
and then simulated.</P>

<H4>Symmetry Design Systems Alliance</H4>

<P>VeriBest has partnered with Symmetry to provide our customers with Symmetry's
world class analog modeling capabilities. Any of their 15,100+ models can
be ordered at a partnership discount, either by phone or directly on the
Internet. Symmetry will certify them against VeriBest's analog simulation
engine (VBASE) before delivery.</P>

<H4>PSpice Compliant Models</H4>

<P>A great many device vendors supply free SPICE models for their products
directly over the Internet - over 9000 and growing! The vast majority of
these models are either PSpice models or are in PSpice format. The VeriBest
Analog environment provides a utility, p2v, to verify a model's syntax and
format for use with VBASE allowing users to leverage yet another model source.</P>

<H4>Custom Modeling</H4>

<P>Do you have a need for a SPICE model of a device that is so new, so leading
edge, that one is not yet available from any of the previously mentioned
sources? Both VeriBest and Symmetry provide custom modeling services. The
consulting organization of VeriBest, the Leadership Engineering Organization
(LEO), has analog experts on staff that can provide custom modeling. Symmetry
has modeling experts on staff that will provide you a model guaranteed to
work with VeriBest Analog.</P>

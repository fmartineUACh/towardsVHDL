<H2>The Affordable Solution for FPGA and System on FPGA Design</H2>
<H3>System designers require the best blend of high capacity,
performance and system level flexibility. To meet these demands,
particularly for the flexibility and time-to-market issues, system
designers have been considering using Field Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGA) for some time. Meanwhile, advances in FPGA technology
have created high density, high performance devices which should
largely eliminate the need for most ASIC components. To address
these advances in FPGA capacity, performance and cost-effectiveness
whilst meeting the system designer's requirements, VeriBest has
introduced the FPGA Desktop series for FPGA and System on FPGA
design.</H3>
<H4>Time-to-Market</H4>
<P>
Design creation is one of the bottlenecks to time
to market with as much as 70% of the designers time spent in this
highly iterative process. The design creation process is changing
as HDL methods become mainstream. Functional requirements (state
machine, adders, FPGA I/O configuration) may benefit from different
definition methods. Desktop
Individual is a design creation environment that supports three
different methods from schematic, state diagram and textual HDL.You
choose the method that best suits the requirement. Another powerful
feature is that the Desktop Individual provides data and configuration
management. The tools are integrated, no merging of files by hand.
 FPGA designers can benefit from these capabilities. Minimize
your time to market with the affordable FPGA Desktop Individual.
<P>
Desktop Individual offers built in
support for design re-use or Intellectual property (IP).

<H4>Design Management</H4>
<P>
Design management tools provided include design object,
design hierarchy and design flow managers. The award winning
VeriBest DesignView design manager, gives the designer the choice
of using VeriBest's own integrated simulation tools, integrated
FPGA synthesis tools like Synopsys' FPGA Express or Synplicity's
Synplify in conjunction with integrated FPGA vendor place &amp;
route tools. With it's combination of graphical design objects
, hierarchical views, simulation data manager and FPGA Vendor
Place and Route configuration manager, complex design management
has never been easier than with VeriBest's DesignView design manager.

<H4>Mixed Design Definition</H4>
<P>
VeriBest's textual and graphical editors also make
light work of the individual design tasks, making best use of
native Microsoft capabilities. Automatic VHDL and Verilog generators
allow designers to design as they think and not worry about HDL
style issues for downstream synthesis tools such as Synopsys'
FPGA Express or Synplicity's Synplify."<BR>

<H4>Built on Standards</H4>
<P>
With FPGA Desktop Individual you can
automatically generate industry standard VHDL or Verilog for the
entire design, all at the same time.

<H4>True Source level Debugging</H4>
<P>
Traditionally source-level debugging has only been
associated with textual HDL-level representations. With VeriBest
Origin's graphical editors the &quot;source&quot; refers to any
form of design representation including graphical state diagrams,
flowcharts or spreadsheet type truth tables, boolean equations
or state tables. This very importantly allows each portion of
the design to be debugged in its original source format, offering
significant gains in designer productivity. This true source level
debugging is fully integrated into the VeriBest simulators. 
<H4>On-line Verification</H4>
<P>
FPGA Desktop's schematic and State Diagram editors
have built in on-line syntax verification functions, providing
immediate feedback to design
definition.This is particularly important for multi-user project
based design teams. Such verification includes connectivity,
HDL syntax, assignment and state register consistency, state,
clock, reset, guard values and bus reference checks.
<H4>FPGA Vendor Support</H4>
<P>
Desktop Individual offers integrated design flow
support for all of the following FPGA vendors - Actel, Altera,
Lattice, Lucent ORCA or Xilinx
<P>
<img src="../../images/digital/individual4.gif" width=405 height=462 border=0 alt="">
<H4>Scalability</H4>
<P>
FPGA Desktop Individual is also fully scalable to
FPGA Desktop Team which additionally offers team-wide based multi-vendor
FPGA design for all the above FPGA vendors.

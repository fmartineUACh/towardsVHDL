!	Plotter control file. Defines the characteristics of the plotter and
!	the display of Veribest Design Capture data. Optimised for the HP7475A 
!	plotters. Lines beginning with an exclamation mark are treated as 
!	comments.
!
!
!	This section sets up the default plotting scale. The plotting scale
!	can be overridden on the command line for the plotting program. ie
!		/scale=n
!	but here you specify your normal default value.
!	you can also specify 'fit' on this line to 'fit to page' by default.
!
*DEFAULT_PLOT_SCALE
fit
!
!
!	This section allows the user to optionally rotate the plot by some
!	amount on the plotter bed. Allowed responses are 'yes/no/0/90/180/270'.
!	This rotation entry can be overriden on the command line. ie
!	/rotate=no or /rotate=yes or /rotate=0 or /rotate=90 or /rotate=180
!	or /rotate=270.  Setting this value to 'yes' is the same as setting
!	it to 90.
!
*ROTATE_PLOT
no
!
!
!	The three sections below define the margins which will be used to
!	determine the scale and centering of the plot.  The margins
!	defined are standard for HPGL/2 plotters and should work for
!	most plotters, however, your plotter may have smaller margins.
!	No other margins are provided for except that .1 inch is added
!	to the borders when calculating scaling.  Room for the title
!	will also be reserved if a title is desired.  HP plotters set the
!	long axis of the paper to the X axis.  These margins assume
!	the paper has been loaded with the short axis parallel to the
!	platen.  If the paper is loaded with the long edge parallel to the
!	platen clipping of the plot may occur.
!
*TOP_MARGIN
16mm
!
*SIDE_MARGIN
16mm
!
*BOTTOM_MARGIN
40mm
!
!
!       This section defines the dimensions of the paper which are used by
!	the printer/plotter.   The plotting program allows for one quarter
!	inch of "dead area" on each side of the page.  So, the effective plot
!	size will actually be one half inch smaller (in both X and Y) than what
!	is specified.  Specify the X axis first then the Y axis. The units which
!	must also be included are either 'in' for inches or 'mm' for 
!	millimeters.
!	Place a comma between the X and Y values. This allows the plotting
!	program to check that the plot won't be too big for the plotter or if
!	stripping the plot the size of each piece of circuit to be placed on a
!	plot.  Please note that an A-size schematic will not fit on an A-size
!	sheet when plotted with a scale factor of 1.  This is because of the 
!	"dead area" on the edges of the sheet that can not be drawn on.
!
!	The following are settings for standard page sizes.
!	Use only one page size at a time.
!	
!	Note that the X,Y dimensions are reversed.  This is because of the
!	orientation of the X,Y axis on HP Plotters.
!
*PLOT_SIZE_MAX
11in,  8.5in				!A size (8.5in x 11in)
!17in, 11in				!B size (11in  x 17in)
!22in, 17in				!C size (17in  x 22in)
!34in, 22in				!D size (22in  x 34in)
!44in, 34in				!E size (34in  x 44in)
!
!
!	Definition of the pen width versus pen number placed in the plotter.
!	Declare an entry for each pen that you intend to use in the plotter.
!	A maximum of 16 pens may be defined, but, only use the pens that are
!	appropriate for the plotter you are using.  The color is only here as a
!	comment for the users benefit.  Adjust the pen widths to reflect the
!	actual width of the pen in the plotter.
!
*PEN_TABLE
#1	0.3mm							!black
#2	0.3mm							!blue
#3	0.3mm							!green
#4	0.3mm							!cyan
#5	0.3mm							!red

#7	0.3mm							!yellow
#8	0.3mm							!white

!
!	Color numbers in DCTOHPGL refer to the colors defined in the Veribest
!	Design Capture environment.  Use these color numbers to specify 
!	alternate colors for VBDC objects below. Your colors may have been 
!	changed, but, by default the colors are:
!
!		0 =  black		8 =  light gray
!		1 =  blue		9 =  dark blue
!		2 =  green		10 = dark green
!		3 =  cyan		11 = dark cyan
!		4 =  red		12 = dark red
!		5 =  magenta		13 = dark magenta
!		6 =  yellow		14 = dark yellow
!		7 =  white		15 = dark gray
!
!       Because there is a limitation of the colors available when plotting to 
!	HPGL devices the user must be able to map the available VBDC colors 
!	(above) to the current HPGL pens.  The following section provides the 
!	user with the ability to specify which hpgl pen number to use for each 
!	VeriBest Design Capture color
!
*PEN_COLOR_MAPPING
!	VBDC Color # 	       Use HPGL pen #	Differs if your 
!						HPGL pens are different.
	0			1		! maps black 	   
	1			2		! maps blue	  
	2			3		! maps green	 
	3			4		! maps cyan	
	4			5		! maps red
	5			6		! maps magenta	   
	6			7		! maps yellow	   
	7			8		! maps white	   
!
!	The next entry specifies whether a plot may be stripped into several
!	section if its to big to be plotted at the requested scale factor. The
!	allowed responses are 'yes/no'. An entry of 'no' implies that the plot
!	is not to be partitioned and hence must fit onto the plotter at the
!	specified scale. If its too big the user will be informed. An entry of
!	'yes' means chop up the plot into as many pieces as necessary and place
!	each piece into a seperate plot file. The individual files can be sent
!	to the plotter and the sheets glued together. Stripping allows a plot of
!	a circuit to be made when the plot is physically larger than the plotter
!	size.
!
*STRIP_PLOT_ALLOWED
yes
!
!
!	The text_limb_width is the width of the strokes that make up
!	an unscaled character of 2.0mm.  Since, the width of the
!	strokes of characters cannot be changed in the VBDC 
!	editor, changing this value will result in a different
!	look than what is on the screen.
!
*TEXT_LIMB_WIDTH
    0.2mm
!
!
!	The next section specifies whether lines are to be drawn with their 
!	true width. If it is set to 'no' all lines will be drawn with a width 
!	of '1' pen. This will serve to speed up the plotting process as well 
!	as preserve the pen life.  If this value is set to 'yes' all the 
!	objects in a schematic will be drawn with their true width.  
!	WARNING - this will take longer and will cut short the life of your 
!	plotter pens.  We recommend you use the value 'yes' sparingly.
!
*WIDE_LINE_PLOTTING
no
!
!
!	The next entry specifies whether the user will be able to override the 
!	original graphics attributes of the objects stored in the schematic.
!	If this entry is set to 'yes' then the plot generated will look exactly
!	like what is displayed on the screen(WYSIWYG).  If this entry is set to 
!	'no' then the appearance of the plot will be controlled by the values
!	specified in this file which appear after(below) this entry.  In 
!	otherwords, all entries below this line except *INITIALIZATION_DATA and
!	*TERMINATION_DATA will be ignored if this entry is set to 'yes'. If 
!	this value is set to 'no' then all values below this line will control 
!	the appearance of the plot.
! 
*WYSIWYG
yes
!
!
!	The next 4 sections define various widths of objects. All the
!	specified widths can be in inches, denoted by 'in' immediately
!	following the number, or by 'mm' immediately following the number
!
*WIRE_WIDTH
    0.25mm 
*BUSS_WIDTH
    0.9mm
*SOLDER_DOT_RADIUS
    0.75mm
*BUSS_SOLDER_DOT_RADIUS
    1.4mm
!
!
!	Next section controls the display of text items. For each text type
!	we can determine whether a visible or invisible entry of that text type
!	will be plotted. We can also specify the pen number to be used for
!	plotting so that different colored pens can be used for different
!	text types. Allowed responses to text visibility are 'yes/no'.

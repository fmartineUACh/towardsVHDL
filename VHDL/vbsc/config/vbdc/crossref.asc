!	CROSSREF  - Version 15.0.0.0
!
!	CROSSREF config file. Contains information about the text to be added as
!	sheet pointer text.
!
!	All lines must be a comment line (beginning with a '!') or
!	or a keyword line (beginning with a '*' followed by one of the
!	recognized keywords).
!	Comments may also follow any keyword line.
!
!.. Specify whether page names, zone names and net id's should be upper or lower case
!	Permitted values are:
!	'lower' for lower case
!   'upper' for upper case
*CASE lower
!
!..	Define the text type to be used for sheet pointer text.
!*TEXTTYPE "Sheet Pointer"	! define type of text to be added.
*TEXTTYPE 26			! may give text type number instead.
!
!..	Define the page naming convention used for CROSSREF. 
!	You may specify the minimum number of
!	digits to write numeric page names in.
!	Page names are formated using this convention when constructing
!	the sheet list for each netname.
!	Permitted values are:
!		'alpha' for alphabetic (single letter, uses *CASE above),
!		'numeric(1)' for single digit (where possible) page names,
!		'numeric(2)' for two digit page names,
*PAGE_NAMES	numeric(1)
!
!..	Define the text descriptors. We have one for each direction
!	of the off- or onto- page connector cell it's to be attached to.
!	*UP is for connectors that point up.
!	*DOWN is for connectors that point down.
!	*RIGHT is for connectors that point right.
!	*LEFT is for connectors that point left.
!
!	Each text descriptor defines:
!		1) a text justification - consisting of paragraph and line
!		   justifications, separated by a comma. Paragraph
!		   justifications may be TOP, MIDDLE or BOTTOM. Line
!		   justifications may be LEFT, CENTER or RIGHT.

!		2) rotate the text with the rotated connector cells (optional)
!		   It's written upwards with these cells if specified.
!		   The ROTATE option is only meaningful for *UP and *DOWN.

!		NOTE: If there is already text of the type defined by *TEXTTYPE above
!		   on the connector, that text will be used as a template and
!		   the justificaton and rotation defined here will be ignored. 
!		   To force the use of this information, use the -delete option
!		   which will delete the text before starting to annotate.

!       3) the 'control' strings.  There can be up to three
!          strings enclosed in double quotes and defines the
!          contents and layout of the string to be added to
!		   cells going in each direction.  First string is a prefix
!		   string and is processed once at the beginning.  Second
!		   string is processed once for each connection.  Third string
!		   is a postfix string is processed once at the end.

!		   The strings may contain any character except '"'
!		   but special sequences are:
!			\r	- carriage return
!
!			%s	- insert the sheet list here (see below).  %s isn't
!                 real useful with the -hier option because it only
!                 includes the page number and not the block name.
!                 using %b and %p would be more useful.  %s will
!				  probably only be used in a prefix or postfix control
!				  string or you will get 1 list for every connection.
!
!			%k	- insert the unique net key (mnenomic) here.
!
!			%p	- insert a single sheet here.  For Prefix and Post fix
!                 control strings, this is the sheet number of the 
!                 connector being annotated.  For the middle control string
!                 this is the sheet number of the other connection.  When
!                 using -hier, you probably want to use %b as well as %p.
!
!			%n	- insert the local netname.  For Prefix and Postfix control
!                 strings, this is the name of the net connected to the 
!			      connector being annotated.  For the middle control string
!				  this is the netname of the other connection.
!
!			%f	- insert the flat netname.
!
!			%b	- insert the block instance path.  For Prefix and 
!				  Postfix control strings, this is the path to the connector
!				  being annotated.  For the middle control string, this
!				  is the block instance path to the other connection.
!
!			The following special sequences will probably only be
!			used in the middle control string.  When used in the
!			prefix or postfix control string, this is the information 
!			for	the connector being annotated.
!			
!			%x	- insert the X coordinate of the connector.
!			%y	- insert the Y coordinate of the connector
!			%h	- insert the horizontal zone label
!			%v	- insert the vertical zone label
!
!		Examples
!
!		Use of all 3 control strings and coordinate and zone info
!*LEFT	just=MIDDLE, RIGHT		"%b(%p):%n " "%b(%p):%h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!
! The following line does the same thing as *RIGHT in the next section
! This just shows how the same thing can be specified with a prefix and %p.
!*RIGHT	just=MIDDLE, LEFT		"%n sht " "%p"
!
!*UP	just=BOTTOM, CENTER	ROTATE	"sht %s %n"
!*DOWN	just=TOP,    CENTER	ROTATE	"%n sht %s"
!
!		Add the text at the end of the cell..
!*LEFT	just=MIDDLE, RIGHT		"sht %s %n"
!*RIGHT	just=MIDDLE, LEFT		"%n sht %s"
!*UP	just=BOTTOM, CENTER	ROTATE	"sht %s %n"
!*DOWN	just=TOP,    CENTER	ROTATE	"%n sht %s"
!
!		Add the text along (under) the wire..
*LEFT	just=TOP,    LEFT		"sht %s %n"
*RIGHT	just=TOP,    RIGHT		"%n sht %s"
*UP	just=TOP,    LEFT	ROTATE	"sht %s %n"
*DOWN	just=BOTTOM, LEFT	ROTATE	"%n sht %s"
!
!..	Define the list descriptors. There's two of these, and they define
!	what goes in the '%s' section of the control strings above.
!	The SOURCE list is used for the 'source' of a particular
!	net, and the TARGET list is used for all other occurances.
!
!	When processing a single block, the source is the connector
!	with an input pin (normally an Output Connector), since this
!	is where the net leaves that page and goes to all the other pages.
!
!	When using the -hier option, the source is the connector connected
!	to the top most occurance of the net in the hierarchy.
!
!	Each list descriptor contains a 'list=' directive, which defines
!	the maximum number of sheets to be listed. It's value may be 
!	any number or 'NONE' or 'ALL'.
!	If the list value is 'ALL' or greater than 1, there must also be
!	a separator directive. The separator is used to separate the
!	listed sheets. The separator string may be upto 6 characters long,
!	(if in double quotes) or a single character by itself. It may not
!	contain the '!' or '"' character.
!	Each sheet in the list is written according the the PAGE_NAMING
!	convention specified above.
!
*SOURCE	list=ALL	sep=","
*TARGET	list=1
!
!.. Define the types of connectors that should be annotated.  This is
!   a comma separated list of quoted strings where the string needs
!   to match the symbol type text defined in the Project Options file
!   (vbdcsys.asc).
!
*SYMBOL_TYPE "Inter page connector","Hierarchical connector"
!
!.. Define whether connectors should be annotated with
!   information from all other types of connectors or only with
!   information from the same type of connection.  A value of 'ALL'
!   indicates that all connectors are annotated with information from
!   all other types.  A value of 'LIKE' means that connectors are
!   only annotated with information from connectors of like types.
!
*TYPE ALL
!
!.. Define the string to be used as a separator between annotations
!   on the same symbol that apply to different instances of the block.
!
*INSTANCE_SEP ";"

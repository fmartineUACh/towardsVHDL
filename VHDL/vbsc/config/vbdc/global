!	Each line of the global file is composed of three sections, the last
!	section, the SUPPLY section, is optional.
!	The sections are:
!		NETNAME - name of net to be treated as global.
!
!		ALLOWED TAP ROTATIONS (unused) - four values, each corresponding
!		to 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees, a non-zero value means that the
!		tap may be placed at that rotation.
!
!		SUPPLY ATTRIBUTE (optional) - syntax is SUPPLY=value, where
!		'value' is either, GND, POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. Used to specify
!		that a net is a supply (power supply) net. Omit this field
!		if a normal signal net.

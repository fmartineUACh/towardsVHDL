<H2>The VeriBest Solution for high-density FPGA and System on
FPGA Design</H2>
<H3>System designers require the best blend of high capacity,
performance and system level flexibility. To meet these demands,
particularly for the flexibility and time-to-market issues, system
designers have been considering using Field Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGA) for some time. Meanwhile, advances in FPGA technology
have created high density, high performance devices which should
largely eliminate the need for most ASIC components. To address
these advances in FPGA capacity, performance and cost-effectiveness
whilst meeting the system designer's requirements, VeriBest has
introduced the FPGA Desktop series for FPGA and System on FPGA
design.</H3>
<H4>Time-to-Market</H4>
<P>
Design creation is one of the bottlenecks to time
to market with as much as 70% of the designers time spent in this
highly iterative process. The design creation process is changing
as HDL methods become mainstream. Functional requirements (state
machine, adders, FPGA I/O configuration) may benefit from different
definition methods. Desktop
Team is a design creation environment that supports many different
methods from schematic, state diagram, flowchart, truth-table,
boolean equation and textual HDL.You choose the method that best
suits the requirement. Another powerful feature is that the Desktop
Team provides data and multi-design configuration management.
The tools are integrated, no merging of files by hand. Team-wide
FPGA designers can benefit from these capabilities. Minimize
your time to market with the extremely powerful but flexible
FPGA Desktop Team.
<P>
Desktop Team offers built in support
for design re-use or Intellectual property (IP).

<H4>Design Management</H4>
<P>
Design management tools provided include design object,
design hierarchy, design flow and design configuration managers.
The award winning VeriBest DesignView design manager, gives the
designer the choice of using VeriBest's own integrated simulation
tools, integrated FPGA synthesis tools like Synopsys' FPGA Express
or Synplicity's Synplify in conjunction with integrated FPGA vendor
place &amp; route tools. With it's combination of graphical design
objects, hierarchical views, simulation data manager and FPGA
Vendor Place and Route configuration manager, complex design management
has never been easier than with VeriBest's DesignView design manager.

<H4>Mixed Design Definition</H4>
<P>
VeriBest's textual and graphical editors
also make light work of the Team design tasks, making best use
of native Microsoft capabilities. Automatic VHDL and Verilog generators
allow designers to design as they think and not worry about HDL style
issues for downstream synthesis tools such as Synopsys' FPGA Express
or Synplicity's Synplify."

<H4>Built on Standards</H4>
<P>
With FPGA Desktop Team you can automatically
generate industry standard VHDL or Verilog for the entire design,
all at the same time. 
<H4>True Source level Debugging</H4>
<P>
Traditionally source-level debugging has only been
associated with textual HDL-level representations. With VeriBest
Desktop Team's graphical editors the &quot;source&quot; refers
to any form of design representation including graphical state
diagrams, flowcharts or spreadsheet type truth tables, boolean
equations or state tables. This very importantly allows each portion
of the design to be debugged in its original source format, offering
significant gains in designer productivity. This true source level
debugging is fully integrated into the VeriBest simulators. 
<H4>On-line Verification</H4>
<P>
FPGA Desktop's schematic and State Diagram editors
have built in on-line syntax verification functions, providing
immediate feedback to design
definition.This is particularly important for multi-user project
based design teams. Such verification includes connectivity,
HDL syntax, assignment and state register consistency, state,
clock, reset, guard values and bus reference checks.
<H4>FPGA Vendor Support</H4>
<P>
Desktop Team offers integrated design flow support for all the
following FPGA vendors - Actel, Altera, Lattice, Lucent ORCA or Xilinx.

<H4>Scalability</H4>
<P>
FPGA Desktop Team and the very affordable FPGA Desktop
Individual form a fully cost effective scalable FPGA design solution
for the individual or team-based FPGA or System on FPGA designer.

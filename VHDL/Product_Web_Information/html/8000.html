<h4>A company that lives up to its name.</h4>
<P>VeriBest, Inc. is a broad-line supplier of EDA solutions that enable companies
to solve their critical business issues by doing more and spending less. VeriBest pioneered the
Windows NT&#153; EDA market by introducing its VeriBest PCB design solution in 1994 and 
continues to offer the best EDA price/performance available in the industry.

<h4>A new vision.</h4>
<P>Until recently, designers of electronic systems have had only two choices in EDA. Select
a UNIX-based EDA environment for the best performance and capability, but with associated high
prices, or opt for the reduced functionality and performance of PC-based applications, in
exchange for lower costs.
<P>VeriBest pioneered a new vision in EDA by delivering products that provide the
performance, functionality and capabilities of UNIX-based tools with the economics of
PC-based EDA solutions.

<h4>Higher performance and productivity at a reduced cost.</h4>
<P>Do more, spend less. This executive management directive is driving the adoption
of Windows NT in the electronic design market. Companies using Windows NT EDA solutions are
improving time to market and product quality while reducing corporate expenses by as much as 
50 percent.

<h4>Focused on the needs of the electronic systems designer.</h4>
<P>VeriBest delivers best-in-class applications embedded in proven design flows for four
specific technology segments. Our PCB CAD and analysis tools address the physical
design demands of today's high speed printed circuit boards and laminate MCMs. Our
CAE solutions provide a comprehensive environment for system development as well as the
creation of ASICs, FPGAs and PLDs. Analog designers find the most integrated design
environment available with our advanced circuit simulation technology. And VeriBest
introduces unique ways for entire corporations to effectively implement and manage
libraries and processes.

<P>VeriBest has integrated point tools from third-party vendors to complement our core
competencies. Developed with a strick adherence to standards, our system ensures you
won't bear the burden of integration and testing. Mature business relationships with
other EDA vendors support our mission to deliver you working solutions.

of device choices. VeriBest delivers a VHDL and Verilog development environment
that addresses the needs of today's ASIC and Programmable Logic designers. Ease
of use, coupled with leading-edge simulation technology, improves your time to market.
You also reap the benefits of easily integrating the device into a board-level
analysis, which improves system level design integrity confidence.

<h4>The fastest growing force in EDA.</h4>
<P>VeriBest is redefining what an EDA vendor ought to be. Our belief in the
Windows NT platform is just part of the story. We understand you are looking for 
best-in-class tools and proven, predictable design processes supported by

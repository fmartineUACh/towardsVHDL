* VIM_P:    Margin of positive input voltage range.  It 
*           is defined as:
*          
*             VCC - Max(Vin+) 
*          
* VIM_N:    Margin of negative input voltage range.  It 
*           is defined as:
*          
*             VSS - Max(Vin-) 
*          
* V_TD1:    The  first  input overdrive voltage used to 
*           measure the propagation  delay time,  which 
*           used to be     the minimum input  overdirve  
*           voltage  that    force the comparator input 
*           stage saturate.
*          
* V_TD2:    The   second   input    overdrive   voltage   
*           corresponding  to  the largest  propagation 
*           delay time listed in the datasheet.  It  is 
*           the minimum input   overdrive   voltage  to 
*           make the comparator saturate. 
*           The propagation delay time increase linearly 
*           when  the  overdrive 
*           voltage decrease between V_TD1 and V_TD2. 
*           As the input 
*           overdrive voltage  drops  below V_TD2,  the 
*           delay   time   will  be  increased  inverse 
*           proportionally to the decrease of the input 
*           overdrive voltage. For example:  If   V_TD2 
*           equal to 1 mV, the corresponding delay time 
*           is 1 uS,  then the delay time will be 10 uS 
*           for input overdrive voltage equal to 0.1 mV.
*          
*          
* TD_RT:    Delay time ratio, which is defined as:
*                  
*                   TD(V_TD2)
*            TD_RT=------------
*                   TD(V_TD1)
*          
* AV:       Open_loop gain                              
*          
* ISP:      Supply current
*          
* ISP_TC:   Supply current temperature coefficient
*

*          
* VOM_N:    Margin of negative output voltage swing. It
*           is defined as:
*          
*             VSS - Max(Vout-) 
*          
* TD_UP:    Propagation delay time at vout rising
*

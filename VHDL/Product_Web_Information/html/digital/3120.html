<H2>VeriBest Origin is Where It All Begins.</H2>

<H3>Today's electronic system designers are asked to meet aggressive
schedules by incorporating the latest ASIC, FPGA and PLD technologies on
high density PCBs. VeriBest is in the unique position of offering a common
design creation capability for implementing each of these technologies -
VeriBest Origin. Verilog and VHDL are the basis upon which Origin is built.
Industry standards make this an open system. VeriBest Origin offers schematic
entry, context-sensitive editing, graphical entry tools and data management,
all integrated into a powerful design creation environment. Utilize the tool
that best meets the design need and mix methods to complete the design in
the most expedient fashion possible. Because this is an open system built
on industry standards, Origin can easily integrate with the simulation and
synthesis tools of your choice - common creation methodology for ASIC, FPGA,
PLD and board level designs.</H3>

<H3><I>Design the way you think!</I></H3>

<h4>Time to Market</h4>

<P>Design creation is one of the bottlenecks to time to market with as much
as 70% of the designer's time spent in this highly iterative process. The
design creation process is changing as HDL methods become mainstream. Functional
requirements (state machine, adders, FPGA I/O configuration) may benefit
from different definition methods.</P>

<br clear="all">
<P>VeriBest Origin is a design creation environment that supports five different
methods from schematic to truth table entry. You choose the method that
best suits the requirement. Another powerful benefit is that VeriBest Origin
provides data and configuration management. The tools are integrated; The tools
are integrated; no merging of files by hand. ASIC, FPGA and electronic system
designers can benefit from these capabilities. Minimize your time to market
with VeriBest Origin.</P>

<h4>Data and Configuration Management</h4>

<P>Project management tools provided include design object, design configuration
and design hierarchy managers. The award winning and customizable VeriBest
DesignView design manager gives the designer the choice of using VeriBest's
own integrated simulators or plugging in any other best of breed simulation
and logic synthesis tools.</P>

<P>Managing these many design configurations has previously never been easy.
With its combination of graphical object , hierarchical view and design
configuration managers, complex design management has never been easier.</P>

<h4>Mixed Design Definition</h4>

<P>VeriBest's textual and graphical editors also make light work of the
individual design tasks, making best use of native Microsoft capabilities.
Automatic VHDL and Verilog generators allow designers to design as they
think and not worry about simulation and synthesis style issues in any downstream
tools - even those from other best of breed suppliers.</P>

<h4>Built on Standards</h4>

<P>With VeriBest Origin you can automatically generate industry-standard
VHDL or Verilog for the entire design, all at the same time.</P>

<h4>True Source Level Debugging</h4>

<P>Traditionally source-level debugging has only been associated with textual
HDL-level representations. With VeriBest Origin's graphical editors, the
&quot;source&quot; refers to any form of design representation including
graphical state diagrams, flowcharts or spreadsheet style truth tables,
boolean equations or state tables. This very importantly allows each portion
of the design to be debugged in its original source format, offering significant
gains in designer productivity. This true source level debugging is only
available with the the optional integrated VeriBest simulators.</P>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>On-line Verification</h4>

<P>VeriBest Origin's graphical editors have built in on-line syntax verification
functions providing immediate feedback to design entry. This is particularly
important for multi-user project based design teams. Such verification includes
syntax, assignment and state register consistency, state, clock, reset,
guard values and bus reference checks.</P>

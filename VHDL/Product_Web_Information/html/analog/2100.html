<h1><BIG>A</BIG>NALOG <BIG>D</BIG>ESIGN</h1>
		<h3>VeriBest provides a powerful systems solution that enables you to
		complete your analog designs more quickly, easily and accurately than ever
		before.</h3>
		<h3>Now you can leave behind the problems associated with making point
		tool solutions work. Only VeriBest delivers the freedom of a systems
		methodology - freedom that enables you to confidently explore new areas
		and aspects of analog design.</h3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></P>
<h3>VeriBest is Working Hard and Revolutionizing the EDA Analog Environment.</h3>
<P>Rather than individual point tools, the VeriBest Analog design solution is a complete
systems suite of integrated tools. With it, you are fully prepared to complete your analog
designs with a minimum number of design iterations. Ease-of-use combined with powerful
simulator control, industry standard inputs, Waveform Display and several modeling
options work to facilitate your analog design process, from beginning to end.
<h4>DESIGN CAPTURE</h4>
<h5>VERIBEST&#174; DESIGN CAPTURE (VBDC) simplifies the inherent complexities of analog engineering.</h5>
<P>
VERIBEST DESIGN CAPTURE component frames allow for easy circuit creation. Parameter
variables can be assigned to hierarchical components for later simulation evaluation
or single-point design control. By maintaining a tight coupling between the simulator
and the schematic, VERIBEST DESIGN CAPTURE makes it easy to specify simulation sources,
specify components to monitor and specify devices to modify. You simply point to the
location on the schematic. Just as easily as graphical schematic design entry, standard
SPICE netlists can be entered directly into the simulator.

<h4>MODELS</h4>
<h5>A complete modeling solution</h5>
<P>
VERIBEST provides a modeling solution that allows engineers to leverage all modeling
options. This solution puts over 30,000 models at the availability of your analog
designers! The first component of the solution is the 6100+ models delivered in the
libraries with VERIBEST ANALOG. Secondly, VERIBEST has partnered with Symmetry Design
Systems to make their 16,000+ models available to VERIBEST customers at a significant
discount. With the ability to import standard SPICE models and/or translate PSpice
models directly, users have an additional model source through vendor supplied models
over the worldwide web at no cost -- over 9000! Lastly, new models can be created
from the easy-to-use templates that are included. 
<P>
VERIBEST ANALOG supports the latest FET technology model equations including the
Berkeley BSIM3V3 and the European EKV. With VERIBEST ANALOG’s Switch-Mode Power Supply
(SMPS) models, your power designs will also simulate faster than with other
alternative solutions. VERIBEST ANALOG ensures added confidence by staying current
with the latest advances in models. 
<P>
The VeriBest AHDL, DIABLO, is provided to help you create your own unique devices
or simulate optical, mechanical, or thermal devices in tandem with your electrical
system. With VERIBEST ANALOG if you can describe it with equations, you can simulate
it.

<h4>SIMULATION</h4>
<h5>Better simulation with better simulation power and experience.</h5>
<P>
The advanced VERIBEST ANALOG Simulation Engine (VBASE) builds on proven, VeriBest
simulation experience. While VBASE utilizes proprietary VeriBest technology, it
maintains full SPICE compliancy. Designed to free users from having to manipulate
complicated simulation parameters to overcome convergence problems, VBASE is fast,
accurate, and more convergent than SPICE-based, or SPICE-derived, simulators.
Easy-to-use menus make all simulation parameters and functions fully and quickly
accessible.
<P>
VBASE enables you to perform Time Domain, Frequency Domain, DC Operating Point and
Sweep Analyses. You also have the option of exploring Noise and Distortion Analyses.
<P>
Simulation results are readily viewed through several different display styles and
options. You can also customize your results through on-line label addition and
editing features. Output simulation results and reports are also functional with
external tools through comma-separated-value data extraction.

<h4>ADVANCED ANALYSES</h4>
<h5>Advanced analyses are at your fingertips.</h5>
<P>VERIBEST ANALOG makes &quot;what if?&quot; engineering questions easier to explore and
answer using the property override feature. With it you can change component values on the
fly without having to save and recompile the schematic. You can hone in on optimum component
or model parameter values with parameter sweeping. You can also execute stress analyses to
see if the design operates in a region that stresses any of the components beyond their
power rating.
<P>Time Domain and Frequency Domain sensitivity analyses provide data on which components
and parameters affect your critical circuit nodes more than others.
<P>Through statistical Monte Carlo analysis, VERIBEST ANALOG enables
you to explore manufacturing simulations of your completed design, verifying your component
tolerances. With any of the seven delivered statistical distributions, or distributions
you create, you can design corners using worst-case-analysis,
displaying any statistical parameters that create a situation of interest.
<P>Using the Loads feature of VBA you can simulate the parasitic loading affects of your
input and output circuitry without having to represent them on the schematic. This capability
maintains the integrity of the schematics for layout.
<P>Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis of your time domain waveforms provides you with
information on the key frequency components of your circuit’s output as well as identifying
any unwanted harmonics.
<P>Further analysis of your analyses results are provided via VERIBEST ANALOG’s Waveform
Calculator. The Waveform Calculator is an RPN-based calculator that
allows you to perform mathematical operations and functions on individual waveforms, between
and with waveforms, and between waveforms and constants. The resultant derived waveform from
the built-up expression can then be posted back to the display for
viewing. A stack up to 99 deep as well as 99 memory locations are supported.

<h6><i>&quot;Having evaluated the available range of professional Windows-based analog
simulation environments, we found that only VeriBest provided the necessary performance
and functionality that we require, particularly in the support of non-linearities occurring
in fast switching MOSFET and avalanche transistor circuits. The investment in VeriBest
will allow us to simulate all our designs and reduce the number of design iterations.&quot;</i></h6>

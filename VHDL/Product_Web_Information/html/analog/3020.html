<H2>Verification Environment for Analog Engineers</H2>

<H3>VeriBest Analog Simulator enables engineers
to verify both analog, mixed analog/digital, and mixed-discipline designs at the system,
board, or device level.  <br><br>VERIBEST ANALOG SIMULATOR provides a complete environment for
the preparation of stimuli, simulation, basic analysis, or complex
analysis of circuits, and verification through graphing and output.</H3>

<h4>Multiple levels of abstraction with familiar design methods</h4>

<P>To prove system concepts and architectures early in the 
design cycle, design definition and verification can start at a high level of abstraction using the 
inclusive behavioral Analog HDL language DIABLO, along with a library of generic and parameterizable
functional blocks.  THis allows problems to be discovered before significant effort has been
expended at the circuit design level, improving designer efficiency and shortening design cycle times
by removing circuit iterations.  Final circuit approval can then be verified down to the IC transistor
level, if required.</P>

<h4>Verifying analog design</h4>

<P>With the emergence of analog FPGAs, and predicted continuous growth of mixed
analog/digital ASICs, the ability to verify application specific devices prior to
committing to silicon is becoming increasingly important.  <B>VERIBEST ANALOG SIMULATOR</B>
supports native mixed analog/digital simulation for predominantly analog circuits with SSI/MSI 
digital section, together with the extended parameters necessary for ASIC modeling.</P>

<h4>Improving design quality and manufacturability</h4>

<P>With greater emphasis on reducing manufacturing and scrap costs, designs need to be
properly toleranced, insuring that components of adequate range are used in designs, and also
insuring that designs will function properly across several manufacturing builds.</P>

<P>Analysis such as sensitivity, Monte Carlo statistical, and Worst Case statistical enable you to
identify components that have the most effect on circuit performance, identify the likely yield of
a design considering tolerance variations across components, and balance costs of tightly 
toleranced components versus the impact on circuit and manufacturing performance.</P>

<P>Stress analysis predicts failure operation of components by calculating operating power 
according to their use in the design.  Devices can then be further derated to predict 
failure performance, and reports can then be output utilizing comma-separated-value format.</P>

<h4>Optimized cost/ performance</h4>

<P>Inter-operability across UNIX and Microsoft Windows platforms enables existing investments in hardware
and software to be maintained while offering the ability to make use of the latest high performance
personal workstations.</P>

   <LI>Binary compatible databases across platforms and operating systems
   <LI>Consistent look and feel across platforms and operating systems

<h4>Input flexibility</h4>

<P><B>VERIBEST ANALOG SIMULATOR</B> continues the VeriBest philosophy of providing a flexible
environment to drive simulation.  Tight integration with <B>VERIBEST DESIGN CAPTURE</B> allows the user
to provide much of the information needed for simulation via point-and-click from the schematic, streamling the simulation process</P>

<P>By maintaining SPICE 2G6 Standards, we allow you to import models and netlists from other design
capture sources as well, effectively expanding your simulation environment.</P>

<h4>Flexible modeling capabilities</h4>

<P>Our integrated Model Library Manager utility allows for viewing and editing of the over 6000 models
we deliver with <B>VERIBEST ANALOG SIMULATOR</B>.  Coupled with our state of the art simulation engine, the most current simulation 
models in the industry are supported.</P>

<h4>Powerful post processing</h4>

<P>VERIBEST ANALOG SIMULATOR provides your users with the ability to analyze and output
simulation data that is most useful to your design process.</P>

<P>Analog Waveform Display allows flexible viewing of single or multiple waveforms, including 
multi-graphing options such as Logic Analyzer mode.  Label and add text to any graph for 
documentation, or plotting.</P>

<P>Through Waveform Calculator waveforms can be matematically manipulated to predict
circuit performance and future designs.  And any waveform can be exported to a number 
of outside tools through comma-separated-value data format.</P>
